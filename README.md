# Math Misconceptions Repository

A living, collaborative resource for identifying and debunking common misconceptions about linear and non-linear functions.

## Mission

Our mission is to create a comprehensive, educator-curated collection of common student misunderstandings about functions. By openly discussing *why* a concept is misunderstood, we aim to foster deeper understanding and critical thinking in mathematics education.

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from educators, students, and mathematics enthusiasts! To report a new misconception, please use the [Misconception Report Template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/misconception_report.md). For more details, see our [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) (coming soon).

## Repository Structure

- `linear-functions/` - Misconceptions related to linear functions (slope, intercepts, equations, etc.)
- `non-linear-functions/` - Misconceptions related to quadratic, exponential, logarithmic, trigonometric, and other non-linear functions
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` - Templates for structured issue reporting

Each misconception is documented in a dedicated markdown file with a clear explanation, examples, and suggested corrections.

## Get Started

Browse the topics in each folder's `TOPICS.md` file to find misconceptions. Each file includes:

- The common incorrect belief
- Step-by-step mathematical explanation
- Real-world analogies
- Links to interactive tools (Desmos, GeoGebra, etc.)
